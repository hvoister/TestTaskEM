# Get Started

To get started with the delivery filtering program by area and time of the first delivery, please follow these steps:

1. Download the program archive and extract it
2. Navigate to the path  `EffectiveMobile\TestTaskEM\TestTaskEM\bin\Debug`
3. Ensure that the file `test.txt` is present, containing delivery data listed separated by semicolons. If the file is missing, create it
4. Run the program TestTaskEM.exe
5. Enter the correct data as prompted in plain English and in the proper format


The output will be displayed on the screen, and files with the saved sorting results will be created in the root directory if the search was successful, along with logs. If an error occurs, please try again.
