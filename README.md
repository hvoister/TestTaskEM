#Delivery filtering program

To get started with the delivery filtering program by area and time of the first delivery, please follow these steps:
1) Download the program archive and extract it;
2) Navigate to the path **EffectiveMobile/TestTaskEM/TestTaskEM/bin/Debug**;
3) Ensure that the file "test.txt" is present, containing delivery data listed with semicolons. If the file is missing, create it;
4) Run the program TestTaskEM.exe;
5) Enter the correct data as prompted in English and in the proper format.

As a result of running the program, the output will be displayed on the screen, and files with the saved sorting results will be created if it was successful, along with logs. If an error occurs, please try again.
